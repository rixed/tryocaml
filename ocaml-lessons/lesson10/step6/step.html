<h3>Modules to hide implementation</h3>

<p>When you request a module with <code>Number</code> signature, it's important that
any modules that have <em>at least</em> a compliant <code>zero</code> and <code>add</code>
definition fulfill the requirement. You don't want to reject modules with additional
functions and types.</p>

<p>That's why any module with <em>at least</em> the required definitions can by
typed into a <code>Number</code>. Let's try:</p>

<pre><code>module N2_raw = struct
  include N1
  let one = 1
end</code></pre>

<pre><code>module N2 : Number = N2_raw</code></pre>

<p>Notice the difference between the signature of <code>N2_raw</code>
and <code>N2</code>. Imagine you are given <code>N2</code>, how do you
reach its <code>one</code> value?</p>

<p>Try to reach <code>N2.one</code> before proceeding to <code>next()</code>
step.</p>
