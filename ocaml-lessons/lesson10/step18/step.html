<h3>Modules as Templates</h3>

<p>A function is a mechanism to make some piece of code reusable with
different values. In the same spirit, a <em>functor</em> is a mechanism
to make a set of definitions reusable with different types. In other
words, functors are functions from modules to modules.</p>

<p>This is quite similar to C++ templates, only (much) more powerful, faster
to compile, easier to use, but slightly less efficient.</p>

<p>Suppose we'd like to build:</p>

<pre><code>module type Line = sig
  type point
  type t = point * point
  val make : point -> point -> t
  val draw : t -> unit
end
</code></pre>

<p>To implement it using the Bresenham algorithm we only need to be able to draw a point
and move it from one unit distance.
Other than that, a Line module should work with whatever implementation of a Point.</p>

<p>So let's say the <code>Point</code> signature is:</p>

<pre><code>module type Point = sig
  type t
  val unit_x : t
  val unit_y : t
  val add : t -> t -> t
  val plot : t -> unit
end</code></pre>

<p>Then, we are allowed to write:</p>

<pre><code>module Line_bresenham (P : Point) = struct
  type point = P.t
  type t = point * point
  let make p1 p2 = p1, p2
  let draw (p1,p2) =
    ... P.plot ...
end
</code></pre>
