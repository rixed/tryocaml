<h3>Modules as Namespaces</h3>

<p>To reach a definition in module <code>Foo</code>, you have to either:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>open Foo</code> - then all definitions of <code>Foo</code> will be
reachable at the expense of polluting your namespace;</li>
<li>prepend the definition name with <code>Foo.</code>, which may soon become
tiresome.</li>
<li>rename it with a shorter name with <code>let module F = Foo in ...</code>, then
prepend <code>F.</code>;</li>
<li>locally open it, using <code>let open Foo in ...</code> or <code>Foo.(...)</code>,
if you use OCaml &gt;= 3.12</li>
<li>copy all it's definitions in your current module, using <code>include Foo</code>;</li>
</ul>

<p>Some modules, using well chosen unique names, are designed to be opened,
while others, using well chosen generic names, are designed to be used with
full names, which is equally good. Of course, modules from the real life tends
to fall somewhere in between :-)</p>

<p>Try to use your <code>zero</code> and <code>add</code> definitions from
your <code>N1</code> modules and see what style you prefer. Notice, however,
that once a module has been opened it can't be closed anymore.</p>
