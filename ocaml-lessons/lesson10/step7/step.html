<h3>Modules to hide implementation (2)</h3>

<p>Of course you can't reach <code>N2.one</code> since <code>N2</code> is a
<code>Number</code> and <code>Number</code> have no such value. What robust would
that be if a module which is only given a <code>Number</code> could try to
guess members that are not in the interface?</p>

<p>So the lesson is: <en>Two completely distinct implementations of a module type
are interchangeable once they are forced into this module type</em>. Other members
these modules might have are hidden definitively and no program can tell the one
from the other.</p>

<p>Now that we have good confidence with the module type mechanism, let's see
in the <code>next ()</code> step how to compose modules.
